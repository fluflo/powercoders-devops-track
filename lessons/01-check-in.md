## Notice

- Many Topics and Exercises
- Concepts over Tools
- Never Stop Learning

<aside class="notes">
    This track covers a lot of topics and has a lot of exercises. Do not get to
    overwhelmed. It is better to have an overall knowledge of the concepts than
    just knowing a single tool. If you understand the concept you will be able
    to learn the tools. You will never know everything so always keep learning!

## Communication

1. In Person
2. Slack
3. Huddle

<aside class="notes">
    These are the priorities related to communication within this track. In
    person is the prefered way to communicate as it makes the life easier in
    case we have to do something on your device. As we can not guarantee that
    there will be IT-Trainers daikly the second thing you can opt for is Slack.
    Ask your questions in the DevOps channel so that the other participants will
    also be able to see them. Maybe one of the other participants is able to
    answer a question and if not an IT-trainer will try to answer as soon as
    possible. If some things are not clear you can still reach out for a quick
    call via Slack Huddle. Does this make sense for everyone? We have someone
    that would be available every Friday for the whole day in person. Would that
    be benefical for you? Beside Friday all other days will be remote.

## Usage of Generative AI

- Impressive and Helpful
- Interferes with Learning Process
- Last Resort
- Always Verify

<aside class="notes">
    And the final information is related to the usage of generative AIs like
    ChatGPT, Copilot and so on. We agree it is crazy how these services can
    answer our questions even tho they are not correct all the time. But the
    dangerous thing with these services is that they interfer with your learning
    process. This includes making you go in different directions, skipping
    fundamentals or bypassing the problem. To prevent that our advice is that
    you use them as a last resort. As soon as you use them make sure that you
    understand everything they give you as an answer and always verify it.
