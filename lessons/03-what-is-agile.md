## What is Agile?

- Ability to Create and Respond to Change
- Dealing and Succeeding in an Uncertain and Turbulent Environment
- Defined through a Manifesto and Principles

<aside class="notes">
    Agile is described as the ability to create and respond to change. This is
    especially true for an uncertain and turbulent environment like software
    development. Agile was defined by a group of people to uncover better ways of
    developing software.

## Manifesto

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

<aside class="notes">
    Go through each line of the manifesto and ask the class room how they
    understand it. Explain them that also part of the manifesto is the fact that
    "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
    on the left more."

## Frameworks

- Kanban
- Scrum
- Scrumban
- SAFe
- ...

<aside class="notes">
    As you now know agile is a manifest that should be applied when developing
    software. In praxis we try to achieve agile with the help of frameworks. I
    I let you decide if they actually help us achieve agile or not. One of the
    simplest frameworks is Kanban, the almost standard is Scrum, a combination
    of both of them is called Scrumban and the enterprise solution is SAFe, but
    there are many more.

## Usage in Track

- Framework depends on Company
- Track Individual Work with Kanban

<aside class="notes">
    As the frameworks used mostly differes from company, team and project this
    part of the DevOps cycle is not covered a lot. As you are also mainly
    working individually I personally would recommend you to track the upcoming
    things with the help of Kanban. You will learn more about that in the
    exercise.
